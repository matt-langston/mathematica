He never heard a reply and was immediately hoisted out of the pool to learn that he was deaf. Emergency surgery resulting in only partial recovery to his hearing led him to being medically disqualified to fly in space by NASA flight surgeons. This is just one of the many career ending challenges Leland has overcome in his life. Before becoming an astronaut Leland was drafted by the Detroit Lions in the 1986 College Draft to play professional football but a hamstring injury thwarted his NFL career with Detroit and then later with the Dallas Cowboys. Hear his fascinating story of perseverance and how he ultimately traveled off-planet twice on Space Shuttle Atlantis to help build the International Space Station, and learn about his work to inspire the next generation of explorers in STEAM education through his role as NASA Associate Administrator for Education."

Designing with cognitively-impaired users in mind can be very illuminating, leading to a broader understanding of the role of design. The perceptual issues involved for users with Asperger syndrome and high-functioning autism are shaping current design trends—their perception and their alternate sensory reality can be the most sensitive test of universally good design in any piece of software. Hear Natalia's personal journey to becoming an iOS app developer and learn from her experience designing apps for children."

With OS X Yosemite, application scripting support has been added to another popular language, JavaScript. JavaScript for Automation (JXA) extends the standard JavaScript environment provided by the JavaScriptCore framework with support for querying and controlling all of the scriptable applications running in OS X.  JXA scripts are supported at all layers of the system and can be invoked from the command-line, from the system-wide Script Menu, and can even be distributed as code-signed applications."
